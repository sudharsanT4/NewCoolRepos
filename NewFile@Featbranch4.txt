GrapheneOS is a nonprofit, open-source, and Android-based operating system used by many people seeking better privacy, security, and control. Here are some of the reasons why people prefer it to Google’s Android:

No background data collection, built-in Google tracking or telemetry. This means your device doesn’t send usage data, diagnostics, or behavioral information to Google or its partners.
Disabled Advertising ID by default. Advertising ID is a unique identifier assigned to your device by Android that lets marketers track you for targeted ads.
No bloatware, such as manufacturer or carrier-installed apps.
No forced apps you can’t uninstall, such as Google Assistant or Gemini.
No Google lock-in prompts, such as persistent notifications encouraging Google services. You can also use GrapheneOS without an Google account.
No default cloud integration such as automatic Google Photos backup.
Advanced privacy permission controls, such as better protection against zero-day exploits.
Stricter security rules controlling how apps behave, such as sandboxing that prevents apps from accessing other apps’ data or system resources without explicit permission.
